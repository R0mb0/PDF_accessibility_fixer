## üöÄ Features

- **Convert scanned PDFs to accessible PDFs** with selectable, searchable text
- **Runs entirely in the browser** (no server, no backend, no installation required)
- **Privacy-first**: Your files never leave your computer

## üõ†Ô∏è How it works

1. **Upload your scanned PDF(s)** via the browser interface.
2. The tool renders each PDF page as an image in the browser.
3. **Tesseract.js** performs OCR on each page, recognizing text and extracting bounding box data for each word or line.
4. **pdf-lib** reconstructs a new PDF by overlaying an invisible, selectable text layer that closely matches the original layout.
5. **Download** the corrected, accessible PDF.

## üèÜ What makes it special?

- **No backend or server needed:** Everything runs in your browser. Perfect for privacy-conscious workflows or environments where installation of new software is not possible.
- **No dependencies beyond your browser:** Works on Windows, Mac, Linux, ChromeOS ‚Äî anywhere with a modern browser.
- **Efficient layout mapping:** By using Tesseract‚Äôs bounding box data, the selectable text is placed as close as possible to its original location, making the document highly usable and accessible.

## ‚ú® Limitations & Notes

- The output text layer aims to match the original as closely as possible, but may not be pixel-perfect due to:
  - Variations in OCR accuracy
  - Differences in font detection (fonts are approximated, not extracted)
  - Word/line bounding boxes
- Large PDFs or images may process slowly depending on your device's capabilities.
- This tool is not a replacement for professional OCR tools like [ocrmypdf](https://github.com/ocrmypdf/OCRmyPDF), but provides an excellent privacy-focused alternative.
